# CoreComponentsApp

The `CoreComponentsApp` is a React Native application that allows users to input their favorite course and displays a list of courses based on the input. The application follows the input-process-output model, as described below:

## Input
The user inputs their favorite course in the `TextInput` component provided by the app. The input is captured as text and stored for further processing.

## Process
The entered text is processed within the `CoreComponentsApp` component using JavaScript functions and React Native styling. The processed data is used to dynamically render the list of courses in the `ScrollView` component. The courses are displayed as `Text` components with appropriate styles applied to them, including section headers for Core Courses, Depth of Study Courses, and Capstone Course.

## Output
The output of the `CoreComponentsApp` is a visually appealing list of courses displayed in the `ScrollView` component. The list is divided into three sections based on the section headers, and the entered text is displayed as the user's favorite course. The processed data is presented in a clear and readable format with appropriate styling to enhance the user experience.

In conclusion, the `CoreComponentsApp` utilizes the input-process-output model to capture user input, process it within the application, and display the processed data as output in an organized and visually appealing manner.
