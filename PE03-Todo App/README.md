# Program Analysis Report
## Input

The program takes input from the user in the form of adding new to-do items to the list. The user can add any text they want to the input field, which will be added to the to-do list.
## Process

The program is built using React Native and has two parts. The first part involves adding the functionality to add items to the to-do list by clicking a button. The user enters the to-do item in the input field, and on clicking the "Add Todo" button, the item is added to the list of to-dos. The second part of the program involves implementing a tab bar filter that shows either all to-dos, completed to-dos, or incomplete to-dos. This is done using conditional rendering based on the user's choice.
## Output

The output of the program is a to-do list with the added functionality of filtering based on the user's choice. The user can add new to-do items to the list by entering them in the input field and clicking the "Add Todo" button. The items added are displayed in the to-do list. The user can then filter the to-do list based on whether the items are complete or incomplete using the tab bar filter. The output is displayed on the user's mobile device, and the user can take screenshots of the app UI and console to submit as proof of completion.
