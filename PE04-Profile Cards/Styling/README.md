## Input

The input for this program is a data array that contains information for each profile card. Each item in the data array includes properties such as image, name, occupation, description, and showThumbnail.

## Process

The program utilizes React Native to create a Profile Card component. It consists of functional and class components to render the user interface. The ProfileCard component renders a profile card based on the provided data and handles the onPress event for toggling the showThumbnail state. The App component initializes the state with the data array and provides a function, handleProfileCardPress, to update the state when a card is pressed. Styling is applied using StyleSheet, defining styles for various card elements like the container, image, name, occupation, and description. Platform-specific styles are handled using the Platform.select method.

## Output

The program generates a React Native application that displays a gallery of profile cards. Each card includes an image, name, occupation, and description. The cards can be expanded or collapsed by pressing on them, which toggles the showThumbnail state. The user interface is styled with borders, shadows, and different text styles. The final output consists of a visually appealing gallery of profile cards, as well as screenshots showcasing the finished Profile Card component and a gallery of expanded and collapsed cards.
