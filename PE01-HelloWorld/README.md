# Mobile App - Personal Information Display

## Description
This simple mobile app is developed using React.js. It displays personal information on a mobile screen. The app takes no input from the user and processes fixed text messages and styles to display the output on the screen.

## Input
The app does not take any input from the user. The text messages and styles are pre-defined and hard-coded in the app's app.jsf file. The input data includes the following text messages:
- My Name: [Name]
- Degree Program: [Degree Program]
- School: [School Name]

## Process
The app processes the fixed text messages and styles using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The text messages are displayed in a yellow background color, as defined in the app's styles. The app uses React.js components and JSX syntax to render the text messages on the mobile screen.

## Output
The output of the app is a mobile screen that displays the pre-defined text messages with the defined styles. The output includes the following information:
- My Name: [Name]
- Degree Program: [Degree Program]
- School: [School Name]

The output is displayed on the mobile screen.
