## Input

The program takes input from the user in two tabs - "AddCountry" and "Countries". In the "AddCountry" tab, the user enters the country name and currency, which are used to add a new country to the list. 

## Process

Processes the input by storing the entered country and currency in the state. When the user clicks the "Add Country" button, the program adds the country to the list of countries stored in the state. The list is updated using the `addCountry` function, which appends the new country object to the existing list.

## Output

Generates output in the "Countries" tab, where it displays the list of countries and their respective currencies. The list is dynamically rendered based on the data stored in the state.
